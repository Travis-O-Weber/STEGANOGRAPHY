Howdy,

Naming convention:
<filesize>_<background type>.bmp

There are varied background types and image sizes provided for testing to demonstrate which bit selections for randomized palette data is the most noticeable AND for when our size embed at the end of pixel data is most visible. 

Note: Our program overwrites the input bmp's palette (but not it's pixel data). If you want to keep a 'clean' image for testing, you can copy paste from this folder into the test environment. For ease, know testing with the overwritten image has no effect on the output of the hide_<img name>.bmp.
